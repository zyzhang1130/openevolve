# OpenEvolve

An open-source implementation of the AlphaEvolve system described in the Google DeepMind paper "AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery" (2025).

## Overview

OpenEvolve is an evolutionary coding agent that uses Large Language Models to optimize code through an iterative process. It orchestrates a pipeline of LLM-based code generation, evaluation, and selection to continuously improve programs for a variety of tasks.

Key features:
- Evolution of entire code files, not just single functions
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Supports OpenAI-compatible APIs for any LLM
- Multi-objective optimization
- Flexible prompt engineering
- Distributed evaluation

## How It Works

OpenEvolve follows an evolutionary approach with the following components:

![OpenEvolve Architecture](openevolve-architecture.png)

1. **Prompt Sampler**: Creates context-rich prompts containing past programs, their scores, and problem descriptions
2. **LLM Ensemble**: Generates code modifications via an ensemble of language models
3. **Evaluator Pool**: Tests generated programs and assigns scores
4. **Program Database**: Stores programs and their evaluation metrics, guiding future evolution

The controller orchestrates interactions between these components in an asynchronous pipeline, maximizing throughput to evaluate as many candidate solutions as possible.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install natively, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codelion/openevolve.git
cd openevolve
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

We use the OpenAI SDK, so you can use any LLM or provider that supports an OpenAI compatible API. Just set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
and update the `api_base` in config.yaml if you are using a provider other than OpenAI. For local models, you can use
an inference server like [optillm](https://github.com/codelion/optillm).

```python
from openevolve import OpenEvolve

# Initialize the system
evolve = OpenEvolve(
    initial_program_path="path/to/initial_program.py",
    evaluation_file="path/to/evaluator.py",
    config_path="path/to/config.yaml"
)

# Run the evolution
best_program = await evolve.run(iterations=1000)
print(f"Best program metrics:")
for name, value in best_program.metrics.items():
    print(f"  {name}: {value:.4f}")
```

### Command-Line Usage

OpenEvolve can also be run from the command line:

```bash
python openevolve-run.py path/to/initial_program.py path/to/evaluator.py --config path/to/config.yaml --iterations 1000
```

### Resuming from Checkpoints

OpenEvolve automatically saves checkpoints at intervals specified by the `checkpoint_interval` config parameter (default is 10 iterations). You can resume an evolution run from a saved checkpoint:

```bash
python openevolve-run.py path/to/initial_program.py path/to/evaluator.py \
  --config path/to/config.yaml \
  --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint_directory \
  --iterations 50
```

When resuming from a checkpoint:
- The system loads all previously evolved programs and their metrics
- Checkpoint numbering continues from where it left off (e.g., if loaded from checkpoint_50, the next checkpoint will be checkpoint_60)
- All evolution state is preserved (best programs, feature maps, archives, etc.)
- Each checkpoint directory contains a copy of the best program at that point in time

Example workflow with checkpoints:

```bash
# Run for 50 iterations (creates checkpoints at iterations 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
python openevolve-run.py examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py \
  examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py \
  --iterations 50

# Resume from checkpoint 50 for another 50 iterations (creates checkpoints at 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
python openevolve-run.py examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py \
  examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py \
  --checkpoint examples/function_minimization/openevolve_output/checkpoints/checkpoint_50 \
  --iterations 50
```

### Comparing Results Across Checkpoints

Each checkpoint directory contains the best program found up to that point, making it easy to compare solutions over time:

```
checkpoints/
  checkpoint_10/
    best_program.py         # Best program at iteration 10
    best_program_info.json  # Metrics and details
    programs/               # All programs evaluated so far
    metadata.json           # Database state
  checkpoint_20/
    best_program.py         # Best program at iteration 20
    ...
```

You can compare the evolution of solutions by examining the best programs at different checkpoints:

```bash
# Compare best programs at different checkpoints
diff -u checkpoints/checkpoint_10/best_program.py checkpoints/checkpoint_20/best_program.py

# Compare metrics
cat checkpoints/checkpoint_*/best_program_info.json | grep -A 10 metrics
```
### Docker

You can also install and execute via Docker:
```bash
docker build -t openevolve .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app --network="host" openevolve examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py --config examples/function_minimization/config.yaml --iterations 1000
```

## Configuration

OpenEvolve is highly configurable. You can specify configuration options in a YAML file:

```yaml
# Example configuration
max_iterations: 1000
llm:
  primary_model: "gemini-2.0-flash-lite"
  secondary_model: "gemini-2.0-flash"
  temperature: 0.7
database:
  population_size: 500
  num_islands: 5
```

Sample configuration files are available in the `configs/` directory:
- `default_config.yaml`: Comprehensive configuration with all available options

See the [Configuration Guide](configs/default_config.yaml) for a full list of options.

## Artifacts Channel

OpenEvolve includes a **artifacts side-channel** that allows evaluators to capture build errors, profiling results, etc. to provide better feedback to the LLM in subsequent generations. This feature enhances the evolution process by giving the LLM context about what went wrong and how to fix it.

The artifacts channel operates alongside the traditional fitness metrics.

### Example: Compilation Failure Feedback

```python
from openevolve.evaluation_result import EvaluationResult

return EvaluationResult(
    metrics={"compile_ok": 0.0, "score": 0.0},
    artifacts={
        "stderr": "SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 15)",
        "traceback": "...",
        "failure_stage": "compilation"
    }
)
```

The next generation prompt will include:
```
## Last Execution Output
### Stderr
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 15)
```
### Traceback
```
...
```
```

### Configuration

Artifacts can be controlled via configuration and environment variables:

```yaml
# config.yaml
evaluator:
  enable_artifacts: true

prompt:
  include_artifacts: true
  max_artifact_bytes: 4096  # 4KB limit in prompts
  artifact_security_filter: true
```

```bash
# Environment variable to disable artifacts
export ENABLE_ARTIFACTS=false
```

### Benefits

- **Faster convergence** - LLMs can see what went wrong and fix it directly
- **Better error handling** - Compilation and runtime failures become learning opportunities  
- **Rich debugging context** - Full stack traces and error messages guide improvements
- **Zero overhead** - When disabled, no performance impact on evaluation

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete examples of using OpenEvolve on various problems:

### Circle Packing

Our implementation of the circle packing problem from the AlphaEvolve paper. For the n=26 case, where one needs to pack 26 circles in a unit square we also obtain SOTA results.

We have sucessfully replicated the results from the AlphaEvolve paper, below is the packing found by OpenEvolve after 800 iterations
